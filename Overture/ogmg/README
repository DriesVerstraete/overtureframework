               with the Multigrid Algorithm
         
               Bill Henshaw  LANL

NOTES:
  The calling sequence of CGMG is very similar to the composite grid
 equation solver CGES. You should first learn how to run CGES before
 running CGMG.

1. Makefiles: 
  Go to the main cmpgrd directory and follow the instructions for making
 cmpgrd.

2. Documentation: 
  The file cgap/doc/cgmg.tex contains a description of CGMG
  The multigrid solver relys heavily on the equation solver CGES. It is
 recommended that one first understand how to run CGES and then CGMG
 should not be difficult.

2. Example runs:
  
  There are a number of scripts that run CGMG, found in cgap/cgmg/examples.
These scripts use composite
grids that have been generated in the cgap/cguser directory.  When you
first install you will have to make these grids using the appropriate
command file.


test1: Uses ./cgap/cguser/sicmg.dat : Square in a circle with 2 MG levels.
  This test runs through 4 cases
       (1) Possion equation with Dirichlet BC's to second order
       (2) Possion equation with Dirichlet BC's to fourth order
       (1) Possion equation with Neumann BC's to second order
       (1) Possion equation with Neumann BC's to fourth order
  Expected results of the runs are saved in test1.results
