o 3rd order extrapolation for ghost points may use points that are not
  available.  reduce or --> could have variable extrapolationWidth?

o do we need to add inetrpolation equations in finishBC for multigrid levels?

o build a set of convergence results and save with date.

o document operator averaging and boundary conditions

o agglomerate neumann BC's on coarse grid operators
   -> remove iteration to solve BC's

o why does the 'mixed' case have slower convergence?
    o semi-periodic and dirichlet are very close (square40, square40p)
    0 maybe need agglomerated BC's?
