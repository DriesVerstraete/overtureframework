Things todo in Mappings:
------------------------

o = todo, x=done

o Remove small A++ arrays from Inverse.h
  x Remove grid from Inverse.C, use one from the Mapping.

o Make MappingWorkSpace a pointer in Mapping.h (Mapping WorkSpace has a number of A++ arrays in it)


o optimise approximate global inverse and stencil walk

x write a C version of DataPointMapping map 
x write a C version of DataPointMapping basicInverse.

x write a C version of determineResolution  wdh:010316

o remove A++ arrays from RevolutionMapping

o fix ghost-boundaries in hype grid generator
      o default should be last line(s) generated are the ghost lines,
              number of ghost lines == 1 or 2.
      o make consistent with ghost line on start curve (cf. ogen/nacaRefine.cmd)

o CrossSectionMapping : finish, M6 wing etc.

o Make a special "Restriction-lite" Mapping for AMR grids instead of ReparameterizationTransform
    which uses 2 Mapping's

x readMappings: parametric line is created as 3D but z values are zero. Should be 2D. Fix this (2 places)

o write a specialized getGrid for NurbsMapping which uses the tensor product nature of the Mapping

o write an optimized inline getCPU()

o write a C version of TrimmedMapping::triangulate.

o clean up NurbsMapping.C, remove uMin,uMax,vMin,vMax; replace min(uKnot) -> uKnot(0) etc.

o fix up elliptic grid generator and elliptic-surface grid generator so we can smooth surface grids.
