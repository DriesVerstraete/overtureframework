\Large \bf Sweep Mapping
\end{center}
\underline{\underline{Purpose}}:\\
Given a planar surface (or curve) $\bf S(r_1,r_2)$ (or $ \bf S(r_1)$), and a 
$3D$ curve $\bf C(r_3)$, we would like to 
generate a $3D$ volume or surface by sweepping $\bf S$ perpendicularly
to $\bf C$ in such a way that the center of each $\bf S_k$ ring lie on
the curve $\bf C$. At $r_3 = 0$, it is assumed that $\bf S = S_0$ is
orthogonal to $\bf C$ and the tangent to $\bf C$ coincide with the
normal $\bf n $ to $\bf S$. To make sure that the center of $\bf S =
S_0$ lies at $\bf C(0)$, We first find the center $(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ as the
average of all the points that make up the sweep surface $\bf S$, namely
$x_0={\sum_{i=0}^n {x_i}\over n+1}$, $y_0={\sum_{i=0}^n {y_i}\over n+1}$,
and $z_0={\sum_{i=0}^n {z_i}\over n+1}$.
Then a translation that maps $\bf C(0)$ to $(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ is applied 
to $\bf C$.
\\

\underline{\underline{Strategy}}:\\
With a sufficient number of grid points in each direction, 
we incrementally compute the matrix transformation to be used the
following way. At $k=0$ corresponding to $r_3=0$, the identity matrix is
used since $\bf S$ and $\bf C$ satisfy the required conditions and $\bf
S_0 = S$. For $k>0$, the ring $S_k$ is gotten from the ring $S_{k-1}$
the following way:\\
A translation that maps the center of $S_{k-1}$ (which is the same
point as $C_{k-1}$) to the point $C_k$ is applied to $S_{k-1}$. A
rotation is then applied to the resulting points is such a way that the
unit normal to the surface $\bf S_{k-1}$ coincides with the tangent to the
curve $\bf C$ at the point $C_k$. To implement this,
the unit vector $\bf n_0$  of the surface $\bf S_{k-1}$ is chosen to 
be the first vector in a new orthonormal basis. The second basis vector 
$\bf n_1$ is given by $\bf n_1 = {n_0\times t \over \| n_0\times t\|}$
where $\bf t = {\partial C (r_3+\Delta r_3) \over \partial r_3}$. The third 
basis vector $\bf n_2$ is given by $\bf n_0\times n_1\over \|n_0\times n_1\|$. In the
new coordinate system, the rotation is about $\bf n_1$ with center at
$C_k$. Since $n_0$ is rotated to coincide with $t$, the rotation angle
is given by $\cos \theta = n_0 \cdot t$ and $\sin \theta = t \cdot n_2$.
The overall matrix transformation is therefore a product of three matrices; 
first the matrix transformation from the canonic basis of the
3D vector space to the basis $(n_0, n_1, n_2)$, the rotation of angle
$\theta$ with center
$(0,0,0)$ around $\bf n_1$ and finaly the matrix transformation from the
basis $(n_0, n_1, n_2)$ to the canonic basis.\\
For the simplification of the mapping calculations, the discrete values 
of the global transformation $M(r_{1k},r_{2k},r_{3k})$ are considered 
as the points for three splines. With these splines we can calculate the 
image of any triplet 
$(r_1,r_2,r_3)$. If $\alpha (r_3)$ is the value of the scalar we will multiply
(also stored in a spline), the image $X(r_1,r_2,r_3)$ is given by\\
\begin{displaymath}
X(r_1,r_2,r_3)=\left\{M(r_1,r_2,r_3)*\left[{\bf S}(r_1,r_2) - {\bf C}(0)\right]\right\}\alpha(r_3)+{\bf C}(r_3)
\end{displaymath}
\\
\\
\underline{\underline{Remark}}\\
At the limit ($\Delta r_3 \rightarrow 0$) corresponding to  the continuous case, the basis $(n_0, n_1, n_2)$ becomes proportional to ${\partial C(r_3)
\over \partial r_3},\, {\partial^2 C(r_3) \over \partial r_3^2}, \,
{\partial C(r_3) \over \partial r_3} \times {\partial^2 C(r_3) \over
\partial r_3^2}$. In fact when $\Delta r_3$ is very small then
\begin{eqnarray*}
n_1 & \approx & {\partial C(r_3) \over \partial r_3} \times {\partial C(r_3 + \Delta r_3) \over \partial r_3}\\
n_1   & \approx & {\partial C(r_3) \over \partial r_3} \times \left(
{\partial C(r_3) \over \partial r_3} + \Delta r_3 {\partial^2 C(r_3)
\over \partial r_3^2} + \cdots \right)\\
    & \approx &  \Delta r_3 {\partial C(r_3) \over \partial r_3}\times
    {\partial^2 C(r_3) \over \partial r_3^2}
\end{eqnarray*}
