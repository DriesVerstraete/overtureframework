/// \mainpage Overture: An Object Oriented Framework for Solving PDEs on Composite Grids
///  
/// 
///  \section intro_sec Introduction
///     This document contains the Overture source code documentation. 
///   Overture is a framework for grid generation and solving partial differential equations (PDEs) on composite overlapping grids.
///
///  \section summary_sec Overview
///    Here is a summary of the various capabilities of Overture.
///
///      - Mapping's such as AnnulusMapping, NurbsMapping and HyperbolicMapping represent geometry and continuous representation of grids.
///      - Grids and GridCollections such as MappedGrid, GridCollection and CompositeGrid represent discrete forms of the domain.
///      - GridFunctions such as doubleMappedGridFunction, intGridCollectionFunction and floatCompositeGridFunction 
///                hold solutions (fields) on grids.
///      - Ogen is the overlapping grid generator from constructing overlapping grids from Mapping's.
///      - Interactive graphics is provided through classes such as PlotStuff and PlotIt.
///      - Graphics postprocessing is done with classes such as plotStuff, Ogshow and ShowFileReader.
///      - Database support using HDF is managed through the HDF_DataBase class.
///      - Operators such as MappedGridOperators and CompositeGridOperators define discrete approximations to differential operators and
///           boundary conditions.      
///      - Ogmg is the overlapping grid multigrid solver.
///      - Oges can be used to solve sparse systems with e.g. PETSc. 
///      - Ugen is the hybrid (structured/unstructured) grid generator. 
///      - There are a variety of utility routines such as Integrate (for integration on overlapping grids), OGFunction (for
///          manufactured solutions), TridiagonalSolver (for solving tri- and penta-diagonal systems).
