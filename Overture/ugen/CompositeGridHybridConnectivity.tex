\subsection{Composite Grid Hybrid Connectivities}
 
\newlength{\CompositeGridHybridConnectivityArgIndent}
 A {\tt CompositeGridHybridConnectivity} manages the mappings between the structured and 
 unstructured components of hybrid meshes contained in a CompositeGrid.  This class
 enables a user to iterate through the boundary faces of an unstructured mesh and access
 the adjacent structured elements.  The inverse is also available where
 the user iterates through the elements in a structured grid seeking the adjacent unstructured 
 elements, if any exist.
\subsection{Connectivity data}
 
 \itemize
  \item gridIndex2UnstructuredVertex : maps a particular grid and index 
 into an unstructured grid and vertex id
  \item unstructuredVertex2GridIndex : maps an unstructured vertex into a grid and index
  \item gridVertex2UnstructuredVertex : condensation of vertexIDMapping, contains all the vertices on a particular grid that are on
 a hybrid interface
  \item boundaryFaceMapping : maps the boundary element of unstructured boundary faces into a grid and zone index
