  The files named asmo*.cmd can be used to build a grid on the "asmo" automobile. The
  asmo geometry is defined as a CAD surface saved in an IGES file (asmo.igs).
  The basic steps are
          1. ../bin/rap asmoNoWheels.cmd
          2. ../bin/mbuilder asmoBody.cmd
          3. ../bin/mbuilder asmoFrontWheel.cmd
          4. ../bin/mbuilder asmoBackWheel.cmd
          5. ../bin/ogen asmo.cmd
