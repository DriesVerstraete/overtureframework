of the grid classes ?!?.

Bill,

I recommend that people should use the "mask"
MappedGridFunction in the MappedGrid class, and stop using the
"mask" GridCollectionFunction in the GridCollection class.
Both contain the same data, but I expect the latter will
eventually disappear.

It is no longer the case that, by default, the "vertex"
array or any other geometry array in a grid database is
accessed when you use a MultigridCompositeGrid constructor
that takes a grid name.  This is also true for any other
constructor of a MultigridCompositeGrid, CompositeGrid,
MappedGrid, etc., for that matter, except for the copy
constructors.

You should always use the "update" member function for any
grid before using it, to specify which geometry arrays
you want.  As a quick temporary fix, it is sufficient to
use the "update" function for the MultigridCompositeGrid,
and let it take its default argument values, if you want
the "usual" geometry arrays.  For example,

    String filename, gridName;
    Dir fileDir; fileDir.mount(fileName);
    MultigridCompositeGrid m(fileDir, gridName);
    m.update();

It is better to use the "update" function to specify explicitly
which grid functions you will need, at the first place in
your code where you know which grid functions will be needed.
Different solvers have different needs.  Each solver should
call the "update" function once when it first sees the grid.

The default argument values are
    update(what = THEusualSuspects, how = COMPUTEtheGeometryAsNeeded);

Currently THEusualSuspects has the following value for each class.
I don't guarantee that these values will always stay the same.

GenericGrid::THEusualSuspects    = NOTHING

GenericGridCollection::THEusualSuspects
                                 = GenericGrid::THEusualSuspects

MappedGrid::THEusualSuspects     = GenericGrid::THEusualSuspects
                                 | THEmask
                                 | THEvertex
                                 | THEcenter
                                 | THEvertexDerivative

GridCollection::THEusualSuspects = GenericGridCollection::THEusualSuspects
                                 | MappedGrid::THEusualSuspects
                                 | THEinterpolationCoordinates
                                 | THEinterpoleeGrid
                                 | THEinterpoleeLocation
                                 | THEinterpolationPoint
                                 | THEmask

MultigridCompositeGrid::THEusualSuspects
                                 = CompositeGrid::THEusualSuspects
