\section{Class GridCollectionOperators and Class \CGO}\index{GridCollectionOperators}

This class is used to define differential operators for {\ff \RCGF}'s.
It uses the {\ff \MGO} class to do this. The class {\ff \CGO} is 
actually derived from the class {\ff \GCO}. Most of the member
functions are defined in the base class. For the discussion here,
however, we will pretend that the functions are defined in 
class {\ff \CGO}.

\index{GridCollectionOperators!examples}

In this example we use the CompositeGridOperators to compute some derivatives.
This example is similar to the example described in section (\ref{sec:mgoex}),
see the comments there for more information.
