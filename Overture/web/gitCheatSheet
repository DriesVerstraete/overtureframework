Overture/cg git cheat-sheet: 
----------------------------

(0) You need an account on sourceforge.net and then I can give you 
   access to the repos.

(1) To checkout (clone) the Overture and cg repos from sourceforge.net : 

   git clone ssh://wdhenshaw@git.code.sf.net/p/overtureframework/code overtureFramework

(replace wdhenshaw by your sourceforge username, the final argument can
be any directory name you like).  This works from the LC CZ machines.


Note that with git you get a complete and independent copy (clone) of
the git repo (in the overtureFramework/.git directory) and all the
checked out files in overtureFramework/Overture and
overtureFramework/cg (called the working tree).

(2) After adding or changing a file:

(2.1) To store changes in the "staging area" use

    git add <file>
    git add -u -v   (add any modified files and print those that have changed)
    git add --dry-run -u -v

(2.2) To commit the staging area to the (local) git repo:

   git commit -m"My message here"

(2.3) To push (i.e save) files from your local repo (origin)
to the master sourceforge repo:

   git push origin master 


(2.4) To get new files from the master sourceforge repo:

   git pull --rebase

(There is also a 'git fetch' which allows you to look at the
master files before actually deciding to update your repo with
the master versions). 

(2.5) To view the status of your files (untracked, unmodfied, modified, staged)
  git status 
  git status --untracked-files=no
  git status -s 

(2.6) Restore a deleted file
   git checkout fileName

(2.7) Differences:

     git diff
     git diff --cached
     git diff HEAD
     git diff --stat
