To add a new publication to the Overture web page:

(1) Edit the file overturePublications.tex and add your publication. Newest publications
    should appear first in the list. 

(2) Copy your publication (.pdf) to the Overture/web/publications (CVS) directory and
    add to CVS:
      cvs add myPublication.pdf
      
(3) Edit the "build" script and add your publication to the list of files that are
    copied to Bill's main webPage directory.

(4) To see what the web page might look like type "make pub". This run latex2html and
    puts the results in the overturePublications directory under Overture/web. You
    can view the html file in overturePublications/overturePublications.html

      file:/home/henshaw/Overture/web/overturePublications/overturePublications.html

(5) Commit the changes
      cvs commit -m"my message"

(6) Let Bill know that you have added a new publication so he can update the web page.
