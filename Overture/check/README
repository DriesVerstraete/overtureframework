Notes for testing the Overture distribution.
-------------------------------------------

The MASTER source for these files resides in the Overture CVS repo 
under the Overture/check directory. 


1) The main workhorse is the perl script
     checkOverture.p 
   
    It will optionally 
      (1) test the version in the CVS repo or test a version that has 
          been checked out and modified by a user.
      (2) buildOverture
      (3) compile Overture
      (4) run tests

   checkOverture.p should appear in /usr/casc/overture/Overture/bin/ so that it is accessible
   from all machines.

2) The script
      testDistribution
   will call checkOverture.p for different machines. Currently the recommended way to compile 
   simultaneously on multiple platforms is:
      (1) open multiple xterms, one for each platform (but the xterms are all open on your sun, say)
      (2) in xterm 1 type
             testDistribution platform=1 [cvs=true]
          This will start up the test for platform 1 (which happens to be platform=intel.d.gcc)
      (3) in xterm 2 type
             testDistribution platform=2 [cvs=true]
      (4) repeat for the for the other xterms for platform=3,4,5,6.
    In this way you can kill any of the jobs if something appears to be wrong.
     
3) The files 
        displayBuildTestResults.html
        buildTestResults.js

   define the web page where the results are displayed. These files are changed by checkOverture.p.
   These files should be found in /usr/casc/overture/Overture/testResults

4) The shell-script "module" is used to define the environment for the different machines. It is called
   by checkOverture.p. module is located in /usr/casc/overture/Overture/bin/


5) To add a new platform to be tested: (this list may be incomplete (?))

      o edit the module script and add the option for the new platform.
      o edit buildTestResults.js and add a new platform for the web page. Just copy and
        edit the lines corresponding to an existing platform.
      o edit testDistribution and add the new platform. It should be similiar to one of the
        existing platforms. 
      o run the 'build' script in this directory to copy the files to /usr/casc/overture/Overture/
