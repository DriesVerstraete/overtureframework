  o faceDerivative and faceJacobian -- what about scaled verions?
  o interpolationWidth should be in the GridCollection !

  o add a function to grid functions to return the component Range as a Range or Index
  o fix multiply function when passed a link.
  o add applyBC to an array of values on the boundary to BC's other than dirichlet.

     on a c-grid edges.
  o vector gradients.
  o add geometric averaging to divScalarGradCoefficients.
  o clean up MappedGridFunctions: put data in envelope into the letter.

  o applyBoundaryCondition (coeff) on one side using boundary1, etc... as in non-coeff.
  o GFOperators copy constructor and = operator.
  o add more boundary conditions to the Coefficient matrix operators.
  o accuracy of derivatives in stretched boundary layers. tderivatives on valve.hdf gives
    poor results u_xx = (s_x)^2 u_ss + s_xx*u.s   -- large error in s_xx
  o  David: It would be useful if getBoundaryIndex or getGhostIndex (as
     appropriate) would return Index'es corresponding to ALL boundary
     and/or ghostlines on a given (side,axis), as well as just to a single
     line of ghost points. Perhaps if iextra1 was set to "all", then all
     ghost lines would be returned, for example. At the moment it appears
     that you have to explicitly look up the numberOfGhostPoints before
     calling the function.

  o extrapolate interpolation neighbours -- fix to use indirect addressing,
      optimize findInterpolationNeighbours.
  o variable coefficient BC's
  o periodicUpdate( Range ) and finishBC(Range) fixBoundaryC( Range )

  x min/max ... to overcome STL min/max..

o Primer and test routines
    o Demonstrate 4th order elliptic solves
    o FVO test examples.

    x put primer figures into ../figures

    o automatically reduce interpolation stencil width -- keep an intArray of widths to support this.

    o automatically build as much explicit interpolation as possible

    o fix problem with one hole pt on sub grid when rudder base extends to .9 (see sub.cmd)
    o optimize proper/improper interpolation -- do not check proper for interp. points already computed
    o fix noHoleCutting.cmd example, also do something about un-cut points that later cause failure.
    o automatically try to use explicit interpolation unless the user has
      specically asked for implicit.
    o pipes have problem if core just sticks out and hole cutter misses
    o is PlotStuff really needed in moving grid case?

    x could save space by not building vertexDerivative array -- used in hole cutting sometimes.
    x **this was not the problem, using incompatible boundaryEps with canInterpolate*****
      fix boundary adjustment for mastSail2d -- opposite boundary should be computed in 
      a better way -- should be nearly normal to the boundary -- or base on the normal
      "distance" from the boundary
    x failure of pipesCC -> checkForOneSided is too strict. *fixed*
    x add full-recompute to moving grid option.
    x change parameters: "make fourth order"
    x fix fourth-order grids (cic.4.cmd)

o Plotting:
   o vary background/text colour
   o move plot( array) into Generic level.
   o provide sample command files for plotting contour planes.
   o 2D contours of 3D grids -- fix labels and scale.
   o contour3d - plot axes, should not have to redraw
   o In 2D contour line plots -- plot along coordinate lines
   o fix toggle grids <-> contours
   o Tom Kim: if one could point with the mouse to a location on a contour plot and find out the value 
     of the contoured function there, it would be very useful.
   o add multple levels of command files
   o try to fix Anders graphics problems

   x fix lighting in contour3d (doesn't stay turned off - if grid plotted too?) also in streamLines3d
   x plot grid lines on planes.
   x write a conversion function from .ps to .ppm (or gif)

   x too many grids in toggle menus
   x colour block boundaries
   x colour by refinement level
