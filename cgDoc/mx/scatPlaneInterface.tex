\section{Scattering from a plane interface}\label{sec:scatPlaneInterface}

\input scatPlaneInterfaceFig

As a verification of the interface approximations in three dimensions,
we consider a domain with two materials separated by the plane $x=0$.
The exact solution for a plane wave hitting a plane interface in terms of 
reflected and transmitted waves is known analytically.

Figure~\ref{fig:scatPlaneInterfaceFig} shows the solution and error for a plane wave with incident
field $k_x=2$, $k_y=1$
hitting an interface between materials with $\eps_1=1.$ (left), $\eps_2=2$ (right).

The computational domain is $[-1,1]\times[0,0.5]\times[0,0.5]$. The overlapping grid $\Gc^{(m)}$ 
for the domain has a grid spacing of $0.1/m$. 


Table~\ref{table:planeInterface3d} presents convergence results for this case for the second-order
accurate method.
The maximum errors are shown on a sequence of grids. The convergence rate is close
to the expected rate of $2$.

Table~\ref{table:planeInterface3dOrder4} presents convergence results for this case for the fourth-order
accurate method. The rates are close to $4$ in this case. The errors are significantly
for the fourth-order method compared to the second-order.

We first consider solving the equations with the method of analytic solutions.

The exact solution is chosen as a polynomial with degree $2$ in space and time:
