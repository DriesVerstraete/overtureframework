\subsection{Visco-plastic flow past a cylinder}\label{sec:vpCyl}

The visco-pastic flow past a cylinder in a channel is computed. 

Figure~\ref{fig:vpCyl} show results for $\eta_p=.5$, $\sigma_y=1$, $m=5,10,30,50$.


{\bf Notes:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item The solution was computed with {\tt vp.cmd} starting with $m=5$. After taking 
some time steps the solution converges. The value of $m$ was then incremented by $5$ (from the "pde parameters" menu,
variable {\tt viscoPlasticExponent}) and a few more steps were taken until convergence. This process was repeated.

\item It seems that the grid needs to be sufficiently fine in order to get convergence for large values of $m$. In particular there
      is a boundary layer near the cylinder that needs to be resolved. 

\item It would be better to start with initial conditions that are read from a previously computed solution, using
      the {\em read from a show file} option.

\end{itemize}
