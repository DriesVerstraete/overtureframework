Dear Graeme:

I hope that you are doing well.  I have heard from Professor Nikiforakis that
you may be working again on the visco-plastic equations.

Nikos suggested that it would be good to have a version of these equations in
the current version of Overture. It has taken me some time to get around to it
but I now have added a visco-plastic model from your thesis into the latest
version of the Overture incompressible solver (now called cgins, formerly
OverBlown).  The approach is implicit and much faster than using explicit time
stepping.

The attached pdf file gives a brief description of what I have implemented
along with some initial results. Hopefully I have gotten the basic ideas correct. 

I wonder if you might be interested in using this new version and perhaps
collaborating on a paper?


Regards,
  Bill.
