\subsection{Visco-plastic flow past a sphere in a tube}\label{sec:vpSIT}

The visco-pastic flow past a sphere in a tube is computed. 

Figure~\ref{fig:vpSIT} show results for $\eta_p=.5$, $\sigma_y=1$, $m=5$
for the grid vpSphereInATubei2.order2. This grid had $2.9\times 10^5$ grid points. 
The full implicit method required about $3.6G$ of memory for this case. 
The solution converged in about 20 steps. 

\noindent{\bf Notes:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item The solution was computed with {\tt vp.cmd}. Note: it was important to take the convergence
    criteria for the iterative solvers small enough or else the solution converged very slowly.
\item The grid was generated with {\tt cg/ins/cmd/vpSphereInATube.cmd}.

\end{itemize}
