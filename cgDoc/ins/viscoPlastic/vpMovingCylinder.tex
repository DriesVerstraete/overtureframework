\subsection{Moving Cylinder in a Channel}


This example tests the moving grid capabilities of the visco-plastic solver. 


The flow past a cylinder translating through a channel was computed in two ways:

1. The solution was computed without moving grids by fixing the position of the
cylinder and specifying the inflow velocity and velocity along the upper and
lower walls of the channel to a value of $V=1$.


2. The solution can be computed with moving grids by translating the cylinder 
through the channel with speed $V=-1$ into a fluid at rest.

Figure~\ref{fig:movingCyl} compares the results for these two cases. 




% Figure~\ref{fig:vpSIT} show results for $\eta_p=.5$, $\sigma_y=1$, $m=5$
% for the grid vpSphereInATubei2.order2. This grid had $2.9\times 10^5$ grid points. 
% The full implicit method required about $3.6G$ of memory for this case. 


\noindent {\bf Notes:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item The solution was computed with {\tt vp.cmd}. 
\item The grid was generated with {\tt cg/ins/cmd/vpCylGrid.cmd}.
\item Using $\Delta t=.025$ gave better results (especially for $\eta$) than $\Delta t=.05$
\end{itemize}
