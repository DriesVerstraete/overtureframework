  \item[open] : open a new show file.
  \item[close] : close any open show file.
  \item[show file variables] : specify extra derived quantities, such as the divergence or vorticity, that
      should be saved in the show file in addition to the standard variables.
  \item[frequency to save] : By default the solution is saved in the show file
          as often as it is plotted according to {\tt 'times to plot'}. To save the solution less
          often set this integer value to be greater than 1. A value of 2 for example will save solutions
          every 2nd time the solution is plot.
  \item[frequency to flush] : Save this many solutions in each show file so that multiple
        show files will be created (these are automatically handled by plotStuff). See section~(\ref{sec:flush})
        for why you might do this.
