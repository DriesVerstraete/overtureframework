\subsection{Flow in a heated room}\label{sec:heatedRoom}

This example shows the simulation cool air entering a two-dimensional model of a room
with a desk, computer and partition.
Flow enters the domain through an inlet on the ceiling and leaves through an outlet
on the ceiling. The computer under the desk is heated. We solve the INS equations with
Boussinesq approximation (i.e. with gravity and buoyancy effects). 
The grid was constructed with the ogen command file {\tt room2d.cmd}. The
command file for cgins was {\tt heatedRoom.cmd}.
