\subsubsection{Moving Grid Options Dialog (moving grid options...)}\label{sec:movingGridOptions}\index{moving grid options}

Here is a description of the {\em Moving Grid Options} dialog.

\noindent The push button options are
\begin{description}
  \item[\qquad specify grids to move] : specify the grids that should move and the manner in which they move.
\end{description}

\noindent The toggle buttons are
\begin{description}
  \item[\qquad use moving grids] : turn on/off moving grids.
  \item[\qquad detect collisions] : turn on/off collision detection.
\end{description}

\noindent The text commands are
\begin{description}
  \item[\qquad minimum separation for collisions] : specify the minimum separation (in grid lines) 
           between grids during a collision. This separation is needed so that the overlapping grid remains valid.
  \item[\qquad frequency for full grid gen update] : Specify how often the full grid generation algorithm is
    called. For moving grids, the
overlapping grid generator is called at every time step.  An optimized moving grid
generation algorithm is used which does not minimize the overlap.  Once in a
while the full algorithm is used -- you can change the frequency this occurs
here. Choosing a value of 1 will mean the full update is always called.
\end{description}
