\subsection{Restarts}

 The easiest way to restart is to choose your initial conditions to come from
the show file that you saved in a previous run, see section~\ref{sec:initialConditionsOptions}.
The program will let one choose any solution in the show file as an initial
condition.
Remember to rename the show file from the previous run 
so that it doesn't get over-written before
you have a chance to read from it.

You can also restart using an explicit {\bf restart file}. 
To do this you need to turn on the saving of a restart file, see section~(\ref{sec:parameters}). 
In this case
cgins will write a restart file every time the solution is output. 
Actually, to be safe, two files 
are created named `ob1.restart' and `ob2.restart'. This is in case the
program crashes while the restart file is being written.
Usually both files will be valid as use for restart files.

To {\bf read the restart file} you simply specify this option and the file
to use when assigning initial conditions, see section~(\ref{sec:initialConditionsOptions}).
