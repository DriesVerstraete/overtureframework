--- Scattering from embedded body in annular domain
(1)  
*
cd farBoundary

(2) 
*Make annular grids
make annulusGrids 
* Some grids made by the Makefile may not work correctly. Not all have been tested


(3) Run:
* Run CGFD scheme annular domain with far-field boundaries
* diss is dissipation coefficient. Higher dissipation may be needed for finer grids
* sidebc is boundary condition for outer wall. abcEM2 in Engquist-Majda order 2 
* set -show to save a show file to later plot stuff
cgmx embeddedBodyChirp.cmd -g=embeddedBodyGridAnnulusi8.order4.hdf -diss=2.  -sidebc=abcEM2 -show=ebG8Order4.show

* Run SOSUP scheme annular domain with far-field boundaries
* upwind scheme 
* no dissipation necessary. 
cgmx embeddedBodyChirp.cmd -g=embeddedBodyGridAnnulusi8.order2.hdf -method=sosup -sidebc=abcEM2 
* higher order needs more ghost points on the grid 
cgmx embeddedBodyChirp.cmd -g=embeddedBodyGridAnnulusi8.order4.ng3.hdf -method=sosup -sidebc=abcEM2
