1. The cgmx/cmd directory holds command files for running examples of cgmx

2. Type "../bin/cgmx file.cmd" to run the command file named "file.cmd"

3. Look in the cgmx/cmd/Makefile for how to make (some of) the grids used by the examples. 

4. For parallel examples set the shell variable:  set cgmmxp = ${CGBUILDPREFIX}/mp/bin/cgmx
