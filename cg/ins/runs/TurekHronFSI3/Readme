Cgins: vortex shedding around a flexible, nonlinear beam.

This simulation is based on the paper

"Proposal for numerical benchmarking of fluid-structure interaction between an elastic object and laminar compressible flow",
by S. Turek and J. Hron

This simulation corresponds to the one labelled "FSI3" in their paper.

(1) Generate the grid, e.g.,
  
  ogen -noplot turek_hron_fsi3_grid -interp=e -factor=4

(2) Perform the run, e.g.,

  cgins turek_hron_fsi3_run -g=turek_hron_fsi3e4.hdf -tf=10. -tp=1e-2 -cfl=.5 -go=halt

  - save a show file: 
  cgins -noplot turek_hron_fsi3_run -g=turek_hron_fsi3e4.hdf -tf=10. -tp=1e-2 -cfl=.5 -go=go -show=cylBeamTH3f4.show >! cylBeamTH3f4.out 

(3) plot results:
     plotStuff plotCylBeam -show=cylBeamTH3f4.show
