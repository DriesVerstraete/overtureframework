1. The ins/cmd directory holds command files for running examples of cgins

2. Type "../bin/cgins file.cmd" to run the command file named "file.cmd"

3. See the Makefile for the commands to build grids for the different cases.

4. For parallel examples set the shell variable:  set cginsp = ${CGBUILDPREFIX}/mp/bin/cgins
