This simulation is based on the article

"Shock wave impacts on deforming panel, an application of fluid-structure interaction",
by J. Giordano, G. Jourdan, Y. Burtschell, M. Medale, D.e., Zeitoun, and L. Houas,
Shock Waves, 2005.

The article consists of a flexible beam being hit by a Mach 1.21 shock.  
In this simulation, we simulate the beam as a solid in two dimensions.

Generate the grid, e.g.,

  ogen -noplot beam_in_channel_dynamic_grid -interp=e -factor=4
  
Perform the run, e.g.,

  cgmp beam_in_channel_dynamic_run.cmd -g="beam_in_channel_dynamice4.hdf" -method=cns -cnsVariation=godunov  -tp=1e-4 -tf=5.e-3 -smVariation=g -debug=0 -pi=1 -cnsGodunovOrder=1 -cfl=.9 -show=beam4.show
